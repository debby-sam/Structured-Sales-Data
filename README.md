Step 1: Loading the dataset:
I loaded the dataset into power bi and transformed the data into the power query editor. Canceled the “promoted headers” and “changed typed” on the applied steps query settings.

Step 2: Merged Columns:
I clicked on the transform tab, clicked on merge columns and then used a comma to merge both columns.

Step 3: Transpose Table:
I clicked on the transform tab, clicked on the transpose table to transpose the whole table

Step 4: Promoted headers:
I clicked on the home tab and the clicked on “use the first row as headers. 

Step 5: Filled down:
I right clicked on the ship mode column, click on the fill option and clicked on the “down” to fill the empty, null values and non values above in the column 

Step 6: Unpivoted Column:
I highlighted the first two columns which are the “ship mode” and “segment” column, i right clicked on the columns and clicked on “unpivot other columns”. This helps in reshaping the data and spreading the consolidated values into specific rows.

Step 7: Split Column by Delimiter:
Now i have the order id and order date merged in the “attribute” column. I clicked on the transform tab, split column to spilt the “attribute” column by delimiter and then clicked okay.

Steps 8: Renamed columns:
Now i have 5 columns in total. I renamed them to “ Ship Mode” “Segment” “Order ID” “Order Date” and “Sales”
